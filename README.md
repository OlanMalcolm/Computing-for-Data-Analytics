This repository contains my coursework for CSE 6040: Computing for Data Analysis, a foundational programming course in Georgia Techâ€™s MSA program.

CSE 6040 focuses on essential computing skills for data analysis, including programming in Python, working with data structures, manipulating large datasets, and implementing basic algorithms for data wrangling and exploration. The course builds a strong foundation for future coursework and practical data science work.
